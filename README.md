**Project 2:Logistic Regression: Heart Disease Prediction Model**

This project utilizes machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical features. By employing models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, the project aims to achieve high accuracy in predicting heart disease risk.

**Technologies used:** 
1. Programming Language and Environment: Python, Google Colab.
2. Libraries and Frameworks: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
3. Data Sources: Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset

**Project 3: Pytorch Image Classification: Food 101 Paper Replication**

This project constructs and trains various deep learning models, primarily EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB2, to classify images of pizza, steak, and sushi. It utilizes transfer learning, experiment-tracking with TensorBoard, and aims to find the best-performing model with a balance of accuracy and efficiency.

**Technologies used:** 
1. Programming Language and Environment: Python, Google Colab.
2. Libraries and Frameworks: Pytorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib
3. Data Sources: PyTorch Food 101 Dataset

**Project 4: Random Forest Regression: Bulldozer Price Predictions**

This project uses machine learning to predict the sale price of bulldozers based on their features and previous sales data. The goal is to minimize the error between predicted and actual prices using a RandomForestRegressor model and the RMSLE evaluation metric.

**Technologies used:** 
1. Programming Language and Environment: Python, Google Colab.
2. Libraries and Frameworks: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn 
3. Data Sources: Kaggle Bulldozer Price Dataset

Project 5 Name

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in TensorFlow to predict disasters based on text data from sources like social media and news. By building and evaluating different NLP models, it aims to identify potential disaster situations from textual information and provide valuable insights for disaster management.

**Technologies used:** 
1. Programming Language and Environment: Python, Google Colab, TensorBoard
2. Libraries and Frameworks: TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
3. Data Sources: Kaggle Natural Language Processing Dataset
